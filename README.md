# Passphrase generator
<img src="./screenshot.png" align="right" height="500">

Simple app to generate passphrases inspired by [XKCD comic](https://www.xkcd.com/936/). Built using [Flutter](https://flutter.io).


**Key features:**
* Minimalistic
* Instant loading
* Secure. Does not require Internet permission.
* Free and Open Source


## Downloads
Check out the [releases tab](https://github.com/holykol/passphrase-generator/releases) for pre-built apk files. You can also build the app yourself if you're familiar with Flutter development. I'm considering publishing the app on F-Droid in near future.
